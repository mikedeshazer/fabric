The original docs for this was a bit tacky. Consensus in  a blockchain is important, and the Fabric devs didn't really do into details about this fact in the original Fabric Readme... To be clear, that readme is below, and says look elsewhere. Those docs aren't so clear either. It's a new project. We're trying to help. 'Cuase this could be grat. (This README will be made much more professionally once this repo solves some problems :)) This project is to fix  Hyperledgers fabric glaring consensus problems. And also... you shouldn't be able to turn off a blockchain when it's distributed. Gonna work on that one, too.
Note: Hyper dev mode. Maybe that's what Hyperledger in general should be called right now. There is still hope. Okay...
If this code doesn't work correctly, as is, then here is something you should know. Try that, then check out the rest of the docs below. Message me as mike@thinkathon.io if you have issues. I get back pretty quickly.

Using a Consensus Plugin

A consensus plugin might require some specific configuration that you need to set up. For example, to use the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) consensus plugin provided as part of the fabric, perform the following configuration:

In core.yaml, set the peer.validator.consensus value to pbft
In core.yaml, make sure the peer.id is set sequentially as vpN where N is an integer that starts from 0 and goes to N-1. For example, with 4 validating peers, set the peer.id tovp0, vp1, vp2, vp3.
In consensus/pbft/config.yaml, set the general.mode value to batch and the general.N value to the number of validating peers on the network, also set general.batchsize to the number of transactions per batch.
In consensus/pbft/config.yaml, optionally set timer values for the batch period (general.timeout.batch), the acceptable delay between request and execution (general.timeout.request), and for view-change (general.timeout.viewchange)

## Hyperledger fabric

The fabric is an implementation of blockchain technology, leveraging familiar
and proven technologies. It is a modular architecture allowing pluggable
implementations of various function. It features powerful container technology
to host any mainstream language for smart contracts development.
